# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Overview
This is a feature-rich eCommerce application that allows users to browse, search, and purchase products. The application includes user authentication, product management, a shopping cart, order processing, and payment integration.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview
During this session, we covered the basics of setting up a project repository and initializing it with a README file. We also outlined the overall structure of our e-commerce application, including key features and the technologies we'll be using.

## Features
- *User Authentication*: Secure user registration and login using JWT.
- *Product Management*: CRUD operations for products, including categories and search functionality.
- *Shopping Cart*: Users can add, remove, and update products in their cart.
- *Order Processing*: Seamless checkout process with order history.
- *User Profile*: Users can view and update their profile and order history.

## Tech Stack
- *Frontend*: React, Redux, CSS, Vite
- *Backend*: Node.js

### 1. Project Folder Structure
- Organize project files into separate frontend and backend directories.
- Ensure a clear and maintainable structure for better project management.

### 2. React Frontend Setup
- Initialize a React application for building the user interface.
- Set up essential configurations and dependencies for smooth development.

### 3. Node.js Backend Setup
- Set up a simple Node.js server to prepare for API integration in future milestones.
- Configure basic routes and middleware to handle incoming requests.

### 4. Tailwind CSS Configuration
- Integrate and configure Tailwind CSS to enable modern, responsive, and utility-based styling.

## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

### Achievements
In this milestone, we laid the foundation for the backend of the e-commerce application. Here are the key accomplishments:
- *Backend Folder Structure:* 
  - Created a structured folder hierarchy to organize routes, controllers, models, and middlewares.
  - Added placeholder files where necessary to establish a blueprint for future development.
- *Node.js Server Setup:*
  - Initialized and configured a Node.js server using Express.
  - Configured the server to listen on a designated port for API requests.
- *Database Connection:*
  - Integrated MongoDB into the project for efficient data storage.
  - Successfully established the connection between the server and the MongoDB database.
- *Basic Error Handling:*
  - Implemented a simple yet effective error-handling mechanism to provide clear error messages and ensure smooth server operation.

### Steps Completed
1. Set up dedicated folders for backend organization:
   - controllers/ for handling business logic.
   - models/ for defining the database schema.
   - middlewares/ for utilities like authentication (to be expanded in future milestones).
2. Installed necessary dependencies (express, mongoose, etc.) and created the entry file (index.js).
3. Configured and tested the database connection using MongoDB.
4. Added basic error-handling middleware for better debugging and user feedback.


4. Added basic error-handling middleware for better debugging and user feedback.
